# Software Design Green Home Project
Welcome to our green home project! As a general overview, this application is meant for users to configure their own household of appliances view their carbon footprint. Furthermore, users are able to see recommendations for lowering their carbon footprint based on their appliance statistics (these can include turning off appliances that are always-on and being warned about the appliances that contribute the most). Finally, users are able to explore what-if scenarios and view changes that they can make to their household. At the end, users can choose to go with their original household or the new household!

# How To Run
Please clone the repository into IntelliJ IDE. In the gradle dependencies, we have decided to add the jackson library to deal with parsing JSON files. The dependency should be managed for all users, but feel free to run gradle build on the gradle sidebar or through the terminal. Afterwards, you may run the Main.java file within the application package and run the program through GUI "run Main.java".
